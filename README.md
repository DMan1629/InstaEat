# InstaEat
##### Instant food consumption and custom foods!


## **Custom Foods:**
To set a custom food do the following:
1. Make sure you are doing this while logged into the game and not through the console.
2. Make sure you are Op or have the permission: `instaeat.command`.
3. Have a valid custom food material selected. Custom food materials include all types of food (except for Chorus Fruit) + Player Head.
4. Run the following command: `instaeat set <hunger> <saturation> <chance>`
   - **hunger**: The amount of hunger points (hunger bar - on the bottom-right) the food will restore when consumed.
   - **saturation**: The amount of saturation points the food will restore when consumed.
     Saturation is a hidden stat, for more information: [Hunger Mechanics](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hunger#Mechanics)
   - **chance** : [Custom Food Effects](https://github.com/DMan1629/InstaEat/blob/master/README.md#custom-food-effects)
