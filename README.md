# InstaEat
#### Instant food consumption and custom foods! [SpigotMC!(https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/instaeat.83645/)

InstaEat immediately consumes the food item when right-clicking. All the vanilla Minecraft special effects - status effects, advancement progression, planting - have not changed.

Food cannot be eaten when the both the hunger and saturation bars are full(#).

The foods are consumed upon right-clicking, so holding the right button will not consume multiples. To consume a few times in a row, one must reclick.

InstaEat also allows the creation of "new" food items using the Custom Foods system.
